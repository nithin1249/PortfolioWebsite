## 📖 Overview
This portfolio is a custom-engineered **React** application designed to showcase my technical journey as a **Computer Science (Advanced)** student at the **Adelaide University**. The architecture focuses on performance, scalability, and clean system design.

---

## 🛠 The Tech Stack
* **React & TypeScript**: Utilized for a modular, strictly-typed frontend architecture to ensure high code reliability.
* **SCSS**: Managed custom styling with a focus on a clean, responsive, dark-themed aesthetic.
* **Material UI (MUI)**: Integrated for professional UI components including input fields, buttons, and status snackbars for a seamless UX.
* **EmailJS**: Implemented as a serverless backend to route contact form inquiries directly to my Gmail.

---

## 🏗 Key Implementation Details
* **Secure Communication**: Integrated a "fail-fast" validation logic for the contact form, utilizing **Environment Variables (`.env`)** to protect API identifiers.
* **Component Architecture**: Follows a modern React pattern with specialized components for Project grids, Timelines, and Skill sets.
* **Responsive Engine**: Engineered with a mobile-first philosophy using flexible SCSS layouts and MUI's responsive box model.

---

## 📂 Featured Engineering Projects
* **Nand2Tetris Jack Compiler**: A high-performance C++ tool achieving 100k+ lines/sec throughput.
* **Crypto-Hunter Dashboard**: A real-time MERN stack application with Chart.js visualizations.
* **Interactive Wordle Clone**: A GUI-driven game built in MATLAB utilizing event-driven programming.
