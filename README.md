# Portfolio Website

This portfolio is a custom **React** application built to showcase my technical engineering journey.

### **The Stack**
* **React & TypeScript**: Used for a modular, strictly-typed frontend architecture.
* **SCSS**: Managed custom styling with a focus on a clean, responsive, dark-themed aesthetic.
* **Material UI (MUI)**: Integrated for professional UI components including input fields, buttons, and status snackbars.
* **EmailJS**: Implemented as a serverless backend to route contact form inquiries directly to my Gmail.
